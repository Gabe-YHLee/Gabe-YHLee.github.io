This is YHLee's Machine Learning (ML) blog. 

In 1959, Arthur Samuel, a pioneer in the field of machine learning defined it as follows:  

> "Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."

The key ingredient needed for computers to learn is data, from which meaningful patterns can be discovered and generalized to unknown scenarios. 

Now in 2020, thanks to growing volumes and varieties of available data with computational processing that is cheaper and more powerful, ML has revolutionized many domains both in research and in industries. The success of ML is not just in the past but is still ongoing, and I believe the growing span of ML's outreach will push beyond mere industrial domains and benefit humanity in many forms to help solve the world's global problems.

Based on theories in mathematics, especially statistics, ML scientists develop logic, tools, and algorithms enabling computers to learn. As an ML scientist, I would like to contribute as much as I can to the proliferating field of ML and do my part in making the world a better place.

The main goal of this blog is to regularly write about what I learn/research on in the hopes of clearing my head. Besides, I hope this blog helps many out there that are interested in these topics.
