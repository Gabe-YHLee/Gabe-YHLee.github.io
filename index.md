### Research

I am a PhD student in Robotics laboratory at the Seoul National University (SNU), and my advisor is [Frank C. Park](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u-h3PJIAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao). I have received B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and Physics at SNU. 

My research interest is toward developing geometric algorithms that deal with data that either are non-Euclidean such as manifold-valued data or has the underlying low-dimensional manifold structure, applying tools from differential topology/geoemtry. Those data are everywhere in engineering including but not limited from robotics, vision to machine learning. Moe recently, I am working on the problems in the field of geometric deep learning.
