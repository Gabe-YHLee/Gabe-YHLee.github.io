### Research

I am a PhD student in Robotics laboratory at the Seoul National University (SNU), and my advisor is [Frank C. Park](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u-h3PJIAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao).

My research interest is toward developing geometric algorithms that deal with data that are non-Euclidean or has the underlying low-dimensional manifold structure, applying tools from differential topology/geoemtry.
